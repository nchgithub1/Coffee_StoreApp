                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bean Bath </strong>– The poor beans traveled a long, arduous journey to get to us, so the first thing they deserve is a nice bath. After a long plane ride, wouldn’t you want a nice bath too? We meticulously wash our beans with our magnetically treated Coffee Store Water to extract impurities so that they are clean and rejuvenated.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bean Nursery </strong>– After a careful wash the germination process begins and the beans come to life; slightly sprouting. This activation of new life enhances the levels of nutrients in each bean and the result is an entirely new flavor profile as they are roasted.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Drying</strong> – Once our beans have sprouted, they are dried and prepared for roasting.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Roasting </strong>– Headquartered in sunny SoCal, we roast all of our beans onsite at our Coffee Store Roasting Works facility. We roast our germinated beans in smaller batches to maintain the highest quality and consistency before packing and shipping them to you. Before roasting, we meticulously clean and prepare our roaster for each new batch to eliminate unwanted burnt residue. Using the most state of the art Loring Falcon S15 precision roaster, we roast our germinated beans fresh to order.  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Future of Coffee Store</strong></p>
